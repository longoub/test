### Exercise 8: with else statement and with a float
```py
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello " + name +"!" )
print("Hope all is well. ")

# Ask for temperature outside and use if statement.
# We are going to use float here because the temperation might a float number
# if we do not use floot and the temperature is a floot number, we might have unexpected result.

temperature = float(input("What is the temperature outside " + name + "?:"))
if temperature > 70:
    print("Wear shorts ")
    print("Enjoy your day " + name + "!")
else:
    print("Wear long pants " + name + "!")
    print("Get some exercises outside.")
bye = input("Bye bye " + name + "!")
# this program will not fail if we put float numbers such as 7.3 or 65.8

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello {name}!" )
print(f"Hope all is well.")
temperature = float(input(f"What is the temperature outside {name}?: "))

if temperature > 70:
    print(f"Wear shorts ")
    print(f"Enjoy your day {name}!")
else:
    print(f"Wear long pants {name}!")

### Exercise 9: with else statement and without a float
```py
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello " + name +"!" )
print("Hope all is well. ")

# Ask for temperature outside and use if statement.
# We are going to use float here because the temperation might a float number
# if we do not use floot and the temperature is a floot number, we might have unexpected result.

temperature = input("What is the temperature outside " + name + "?:")
if temperature > 70:
    print(" Wear shorts ")
    print("Enjoy your day " + name + "!")
else:
    print("Wear long pants " + name + "!")
    print("Get some exercises outside.")

# this program will give and error because the temperature can be either a number or a float.
# This means we must use the word float before input.
