# Working with Python strings

### Introduction:
### What is String in Python?
- A string is a sequence of characters.
- A character is simply a symbol. For example, the English language has 26 characters.
- Computers do not deal with characters, they deal with numbers (binary). Even though you may see characters on your screen, internally it is stored and b manipulated as a combination of 0's and 1's.
- This conversion of character to a number is called encoding, and the reverse process is decoding. ASCII and Unicode are some of the popular encoding used.
- In Python, string is a sequence of Unicode character. Unicode was introduced to include every character in all languages and bring uniformity in encoding.

### How to create a string in Python?

### How to access characters in a string?
```py
string="python scripting"
print(string)
print(string[0:])
print(string[0])
print(string[-1])
print(string[0:6])

#OUTPUT
python scripting
python scripting
p
g
python
```

### How to change or delete a string?
Strings are immutable. This means that elements of a string cannot be changed once it has been assigned. We can simply reassign different strings to the same name.
```py
string="python scripting"
del string
print(string)
```


How to find the length of a string ?
```py
string="python scripting"
lent_1=len(string)
print(f'The lent of my string is: {lent_1}')

#OUTPUT
The lent of my string is: 16
```

### How to add/Concatenate two strings ?
```py
string1="Python scripting"
string2='Devops course'

print(f'{string1} for {string2}')

#OUTPUT
Python scripting for Devops course
```


### String conversion
```py
string="Python scripting for Devops course automation"
print(string)
print(string.lower())
print(string.upper())
print(string.title())

#OUTPUT
Python scripting for Devops course automation
python scripting for devops course automation
PYTHON SCRIPTING FOR DEVOPS COURSE AUTOMATION
Python Scripting For Devops Course Automation
```

### Boolean result operation on strings
```py
string1="Python scripting for Devops course automation"
string2=" "
print(bool(string1))
print(bool(string2))
print(string1.startswith('p'))
print(string1.startswith('P'))
print(string1.startswith('Python'))
print(string1.endswith('n'))
print(string1.endswith('automation'))
print(string1.endswith('course automation'))
print(string1.isupper())
print(string1.islower())
print(string1.istitle())
print(string1.isnumeric())

#OUTPUT
True
True
False
True
True
True
True
True
False
False
False
False
```

### Strip operations on strings
It will remove word at the beginning and end of a srting
This will remove space at the beginnig and the end of your string
```py
string1=" Python scripting for Devops course automation "
print(string1)
print(string1.strip())

#OUTPUT
 Python scripting for Devops course automation 
Python scripting for Devops course automation
```

```py
string1="5Python3.9"
string2="3.9Python3.9"
print(string1)
print(string1.strip('3.9'))
print(string1.strip('5'))
print(string2.strip('3.9'))

#OUTPUT
5Python3.9
5Python
Python3.9
Python
```

```py
string1="5Python3.9"
print(string1.strip('3.9'))
print(string1.strip('5'))
print(string1.strip('3.9').strip('5').strip('thon'))

#OUTPUT
5Python
Python3.9
Py
```

### Strip and split operations on strings
It will split the string into list
```py
string1="Python3.7 scripting for Devops course automation"
print(string1.split())
print(string1.split()[0])
print(string1.split()[-1])
print(string1.split()[0].strip('3.7'))

#OUTPUT
['Python3.7', 'scripting', 'for', 'Devops', 'course', 'automation']
Python3.7
automation
Python
```

Split base on word
```py
string1="Python3.7 scripting for Devops course automation"
print(string1.split())
print(string1.split('for'))
print(string1.split('course'))
print(string1.split('3.7'))

#OUTPUT
['Python3.7', 'scripting', 'for', 'Devops', 'course', 'automation']
['Python3.7 scripting ', ' Devops course automation']
['Python3.7 scripting for Devops ', ' automation']
['Python', ' scripting for Devops course automation']
```

```py
string1="Python3.7 is very easy and it is very popular."
print(string1.split())
print(string1.split('is'))
print(string1.split('very'))

#OUTPUT
['Python3.7', 'is', 'very', 'easy', 'and', 'it', 'is', 'very', 'popular.']
['Python3.7 ', ' very easy and it ', ' very popular.']
['Python3.7 is ', ' easy and it is ', ' popular.']
```

```py
string1="3.7.6.34_564"
print(string1.split('.'))
print(string1.split('_'))

#OUTPUT
['3', '7', '6', '34_564']
['3.7.6.34', '564']
```

### Count, Index and find operation on strings
```py
string="python3.7 is very easy and it is very popular."
print(string.count('is'))
print(string.count('n'))
print(string.count('easy'))

print(string.index('easy'))
print(string.split().index('easy'))
print(string.split().index('it'))

#OUTPUT
2
2
1
18
3
5
23
38
```

```py

JAVA_VERSION='java version 1.7'
print(JAVA_VERSION.find('java')) # if the result is 0, java is in the string
print(JAVA_VERSION.find('java2')) # if the result is -1, java is not in the string
print(JAVA_VERSION.find('1.8'))

if JAVA_VERSION.find('java') == 0: 
  print('java is in the giving string')
else:
  print('java is not in the giving string')


JAVA_VERSION4='java version 1.7'.split()
print(JAVA_VERSION4)

if 'java' in JAVA_VERSION4: 
  print('java is in the giving string')
else:
  print('java is not in the giving string')

if 'java2' in JAVA_VERSION4: 
  print('java is in the giving string')
else:
  print('java is not in the giving string')

#OUTPUT
0
-1
-1
java is in the giving string
['java', 'version', '1.7']
java is in the giving string
java is not in the giving string
```
