## A very quick intro to Linux
Linux program will be focusing on CENTOS, REDHAT AND UBUNTU

**In 1969, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie** Created the first version of Unix OS (Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie are considered the inventors of Unix.). 

The system was multitasking and multi-users which means it could support multi-user at the same time. This makes it very popular and a lot of companies start creating their own version. For example, HP created **HP-UX**, IBM created **AIX**, solaris created **Oracle**, Apple created **MAC OS**. 

Unix was a **close source** and Linus Torvolcds was not satisfied, and he started developing his own version of software, and he came out with Linux software **1991**. He released the Linux project under the **GNU** project or Licence or **GPL**(general public licence). Since then, they have been a lot of modifications of the linux software and this gave birth to some Linux flavor that we are using today such as: 
- CentOS which is the clone of Redhat
- Ubuntu
- Red Hat
- Fedora
- Debian
- Opensuse
- Linux Mint
- Kali and so on.

## UNIX Distributions (close source)
- Apple Mac OS (created by Apple)
- Oracle Solaris (created by Oracle)
- HP-UX (created by HP)
- AIX (created by IBM)

## Linux creation anoncement by Torvolcds
Starting this Thanksgiving I am going to write a complete **Unix-compatible software system** called GNU (for Gnu's Not Unix), and give it away free to everyone who can use it. Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment are greatly needed.

## Linux Distrubtions
- Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Elementary OS, and Kali Linux are all derived from **Debian**.
- CentOS, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux are derived from **Red Hat**.
