# DOCKER SWARM



## What is docker tools?
Docker installation is available only on windows 10 and above to run windows containers. If we want to install docker on older version of windows or Mac OS, we need to install docker toolbox which is a set of tools such as: 
- Docker machine 
- Docker engine or daemon 
- Docker compose
- Kitematic: Desktop GUI for docker
- A shell preconfigured for a docker CLI

**NB:** We do not have a docker toolbox for linux. We need to install all these tools individually.

**Docker Host**

**Docker Machine**
- It is a tool use to create docker host automatically
