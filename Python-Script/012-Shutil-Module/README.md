#copy', 'copy2', 'copyfile', 'copyfileobj', 'copymode', 'copystat', 'copytree'

#copyfile-->copy --> copy2
#src="/home/Automation/working_with_remote_server.py"
src="/home/Automation/shutil_part_1.py"
dest="/home/Automation/working_with_remote_server.py_bkp"
shutil.copyfile(src,dest)
shutil.copy(src,dest)   #same permissions for src and dest
shutil.copy2(src,dest)  #same meta data for dest as well
shutil.copymode(src,dest)
shutil.copystat(src,dest)

# copy the content of f1 to f2
f1=open('xyz.txt','r')
f2=open('pqr.txt','w')
shutil.copyfileobj(f1,f2)

# copy tomcat7 to /tmp call tomcat
